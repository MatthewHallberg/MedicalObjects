INSTRUCTIONS: 

Create anaconda environment with opencv
Activate conda environment
Take videos and convert to mp4 format
Use videoToImage.py to convert video to images.
Download and install this for labeling data in Pascal Voc format: https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg
(Keep all in same folder called images)
Inside images folder COPY approx 10 pairs into Test folder and COPY the rest into Train folder
run xml_to_csv.py
Get dataset to TFRecord file format with generate_tfrecord.py
Get config file from Tensorflow models-master repository:
/tensorflow/models/research/master/object_detection/samples/configs/ssd_mobilenet_v1_pets.config
Get the model file from Tensorflow run in terminal from main project directory and extract zip:
wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_11_06_2017.tar.gz
Create object-detection.pbxt in Training folder
Move files into object_detection folder from models-master, put pet config file into training folder
# From tensorflow/models/research/  run this:
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
# From tensorflow/models/research/
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim  
run: 
FINALLY from tensorflow/models/research/object_detection
python3 train.py --logtosotderr --train_dir=training/ --pipeline_config_path=training/ssd_mobilenet_v1_pets.config

after training:
python3 export_inference_graph.py \
    --input_type image_tensor \
    --pipeline_config_path training/ssd_mobilenet_v1_pets.config \
    --trained_checkpoint_prefix training/model.ckpt-1128 \
    --output_directory medical_objects_graph

inside object_detection run:
python3 run_detection.py


IMPROVEMENTS: 
-Downres training images to 600 pixels??
-get training images in different light conditions and all angles!
-do 200 images per object!
-Train on google cloud and get to below 1 error (might be 10,000 steps)
-run detector on GPU version of tensor flow (too many frame drops on my mac)
