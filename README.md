# MedicalObjects
Use this version of opencv to avoid crashes on mac with anaconda: conda install -c conda-forge opencv

To run this project you will need to also have Tensorflow and Tensorflow object detection installed on your machine. 

To run the project do python3 run_detection.py in the Detection folder. If you want to send messages to the glove tracking app changed the IP address to that of the mobile phone running the app in send_message.py.

Before the app is run you will need to set the tolerences for the max bottle and syringe size from moving.py. There is a function to do this that is currently commented out.
